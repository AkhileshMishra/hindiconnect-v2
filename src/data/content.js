    title: 'What Do We Learn from Students Who Scored Well in Hindi?',
    excerpt: 'Key traits of high-performing Hindi students — hard work, active learning, ownership, and positive parent-child relationships.',
    content: `Several of our students scored well in Hindi. Here is a summary of what made them score high:\n\n**Hard-working:** There is no shortcut to success. When a student makes an effort — writing Hindi compositions weekly, sending audio assignments, self-correcting sentences — it pays off.\n\n**Actively seeking answers:** Students who understand their challenging areas like gender, case, and postposition, and actively seek exercises for those, perform better.\n\n**Ownership:** Students who are attentive and want to do well tend to revise their work and take ownership of their exam preparation.\n\n**Positive parent-child relationship:** Parents who actively engage with their child's learning journey see excellent results. Supportive involvement beats being pushy.`,

    title: 'How to Select a Hindi Teacher?',
    excerpt: 'Finding the right Hindi teacher is crucial. Here are the key qualities to look for in a qualified instructor.',
    content: `Choosing the right Hindi teacher can make or break your learning journey. Here's what to look for:\n\n**Native fluency:** A teacher who speaks Hindi natively understands nuances that non-native speakers miss — tone, colloquialisms, and cultural context.\n\n**Pedagogical training:** Subject knowledge alone isn't enough. Look for teachers trained in language pedagogy who can structure lessons progressively.\n\n**Patience and adaptability:** Every learner is different. Great teachers adapt their methods to suit individual learning styles.\n\n**Cultural knowledge:** Hindi is deeply tied to Indian culture. Teachers who weave cultural context into lessons create richer learning experiences.`,

    title: 'How to Learn Hindi When You Are Based Abroad?',
    excerpt: 'Practical strategies for mastering Hindi from anywhere in the world with online resources and native speaker practice.',
    content: `Learning Hindi while living abroad presents unique challenges, but also unique opportunities:\n\n**Consistent online classes:** Regular sessions with native teachers bridge the geographical gap. Small group sizes (under 5) ensure personalized attention.\n\n**Immersive media consumption:** Watch Hindi films, listen to Hindi podcasts, and follow Hindi social media accounts to build passive exposure.\n\n**Practice with native speakers:** Speaking with locals — even virtually — builds confidence and real-world fluency faster than textbook study alone.\n\n**Structured curriculum:** Follow a milestone-based program that tracks progress from preliminary to advanced levels systematically.`,
